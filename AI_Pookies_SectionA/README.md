# 🧠 Fake News Detection Web App

The **Fake News Detection** web app is an AI-powered platform that allows users to verify the authenticity of news articles. Built using **Flask** and **machine learning**, the system analyzes input text and classifies it as **real** or **fake** in real-time. Designed with a clean and responsive UI, it’s ideal for individuals or organizations aiming to combat misinformation.

## 📝 Project Description

This project utilizes a trained machine learning model (such as **Logistic Regression**, **Naive Bayes**, or **PassiveAggressiveClassifier**) to detect fake news. Users can input any news content into the web app, and the system predicts its authenticity based on trained patterns in the dataset.

The frontend is styled with **Tailwind CSS** and **Bootstrap**, while the backend is built with **Flask**. The app includes pages for **Home**, **About Us**, **Prediction**, and **Contact Us**, offering a smooth user experience.

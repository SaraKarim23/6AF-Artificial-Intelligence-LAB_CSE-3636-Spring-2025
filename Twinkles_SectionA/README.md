The project has been designed with modularity in mind and is divided into three collaborative components:

	Quiz Data Module (Shebria Binthey Hossain_C213201):

o	This module stores all the quiz content, including questions, four options for each, and the correct answers.

o	It helps in maintaining a clean structure by separating the content from the logic and interface.

o	Future enhancements can allow data to be pulled from external sources like databases or APIs.


	Quiz Logic Module (Nafisa Ayman_C213203):

o	Responsible for the internal workings of the quiz, such as tracking the current question, validating the user’s answer, and maintaining the score.

o	It ensures that the application progresses smoothly from one question to the next.

o	Additional features such as randomization of questions or timer-based assessments can be integrated here.


	GUI Module (Farhana Mozumder Tisha_C213210):

o	This module handles all user interactions. It uses Tkinter to render questions, display options with radio buttons, and capture selections.

o	It provides instant visual feedback to the user based on their response and shows a summary at the end.

o	The GUI is simple yet functional and designed to be easily accessible by users with minimal technical knowledge.

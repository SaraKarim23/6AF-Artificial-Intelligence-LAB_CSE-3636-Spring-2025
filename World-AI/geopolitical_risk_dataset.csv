"Mithun, Mushfiqur fifties guide Tigers to win in warm-up","<div class=""body field row margin-bottom""><div class=""field-items columns large-12 medium-12 small-12 end""><p>Bangladesh got back to winning ways in their warm-up 50-over match against Sri Lanka Board President’s XI, thanks to a 91 from Mohammad Mithun and a 50 from Mushfiqur Rahim to win by five wickets at Colombo on Tuesday.</p>
<p>It was a solid batting display by the Tigers as they chased down a challenging 282 runs with 11 deliveries to spare. </p>
<p>Almost all the top order and middle order batsmen got starts with captain Tamim Iqbal scoring 37 and Mahmudullah Riyad getting 33 while Sabbir Rahman was not out on 31 and helped chase down the final runs along with Mosaddek Hossain who was not out on 15. </p>
<p>Mithun had 11 boundaries and one six in his innings, which came off 100 deliveries and he looked good for a century, but he will be happy with a return to form after an indifferent time with the bat in the World Cup and in the tri-series in Ireland before that. </p>
<p>Mushfiqur’s fifty came off 46 balls and had six boundaries and a six, and his partnership 73-run partnership for the third wicket with Mithun helped lay a solid platform for the chase.</p>

<p>But it was the 96-run partnership between Mithun and Mahmudullah that ensured an easy win would be possible. </p>
<p>Earlier, after winning the toss, captain Niroshan Dickwella for the Sri Lanka Board President’s XI won the toss and elected to bat first.</p>
<p>A 56 from Shehan Jayasuriya and an 86 not out from Dasun Shanaka off just 63 balls was vital in putting on a competitive score of 282 in the first innings. </p>
<p>For the Tigers, fast bowler Rubel Hossain (7-0-31-2) and Mustafizur Rahman (7-0-29-1) was impressive while medium-fast bowler Soumya Sarkar also chipped in with two wickets.</p>
<p>Taskin Ahmed, who returned to the squad was expensive going for 57 runs in his eight overs while taking just one wicket. </p>
<p>The first of the three-match ODI series begins in the same venue on Friday.  </p>

Jesus takes centre stage as Brazil win Copa America,"<div class=""body field row margin-bottom""><div class=""field-items columns large-12 medium-12 small-12 end""><p>Brazil’s Gabriel Jesus made one goal, scored another and was sent off in the second half as they beat Peru 3-1 on Sunday to win the Copa America for the ninth time in a pulsating contest at the Maracana stadium.</p>
<p>The hosts took the lead after 15 minutes thanks to some brilliant skill from Jesus on the wing. The Manchester City forward bamboozled two defenders and crossed for the unmarked Everton to fire home from close range.</p>
<p>Peru had not won this tournament since 1975 and they bounced back quickly with an equaliser a minute before halftime when Paolo Guerrero scored from the penalty spot after Thiago Silva was adjudged to have handled the ball.</p>
<p>The goal was the first Brazil had conceded in six games since the Copa America began but it did not shake their confidence and they retook the lead moments later after a well worked move from midfield.</p>
<p><img alt="""" src=""http://tbsnews.net/sites/default/files/uploads/2019/07/08/copa_final.png"" />Roberto Firmino showed some nice skill on the right touchline and he fed Arthur who strode forward and fed Jesus, who coolly slotted the ball past a helpless Pedro Gallese.</p>
<p>Peru pushed forward in the second half and were thrown a lifeline with 20 minutes remaining when Jesus was sent off.</p>
<div class=""sc-embed ""></div>
<p>He had been felled by Carlos Zambrano a few minutes earlier and when Jesus dealt out his revenge he was immediately shown a second yellow to follow a first half caution for a bad tackle.</p>
<p>But Brazil, playing in front of a 70,000 crowd in Rio de Janeiro, had the final say when substitute Richarlison made it 3-1 with a penalty in the final minute of regulation time.</p>
<p>It was Brazil’s first major title since they won the Copa America in 2007 and the first for coach Tite, who took charge of the national team three years ago.</p>

South Africa and Pakistan battle for survival,"<div class=""body field row margin-bottom""><div class=""field-items columns large-12 medium-12 small-12 end""><p>Two teams in green, two teams with three points, two teams who are fighting for survival in the ICC World Cup. This is South Africa vs Pakistan at Lords.</p>
<p>Both teams have come into this campaign without much furor about their chances of winning it and they have both had tournaments without many positives.</p>
<p>At least Pakistan had a big win against the more fancied hosts England, but apart from a win against the unimpressive Afghanistan, it has been all doom and gloom for the Proteas.</p>
<p>All of that culminated in the last over defeat against New Zealand in their last match once again when the demons from 2015 and 2011, when the Kiwis knocked them out of the tournament, came back to haunt them.</p>
<p>As for Pakistan, it was a tame defeat against one of the tournament favourites and arch-nemesis India, which has drawn the ire of fans and ex-players alike.</p>
<p>A defeat for South Africa would certainly knock them out of the tournament while a defeat for Pakistan would not be the end of things.</p>
<p>They could still win their remaining games to finish on nine points as they have played one match less than the Proteas, and they could qualify if England and the teams below England fail to get more than eight points.</p>
<p>History favours South Africa, who have won three of four World Cup encounters with Pakistan. Pakistan did, however, win the most recent one, in Auckland in 2015.</p>
<p>This will be the first time Pakistan and South Africa play each other at Lord's. Of their three previous encounters in England, South Africa have won two, while Pakistan triumphed most recently at the Champions Trophy in 2017.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Team news</strong></p>
<p>The performance against New Zealand was much improved, even if it didn't produce the result South Africa so desperately needed. They are likely to stick with the same XI.</p>
<p>South Africa (possible): 1 Quinton de Kock (wk), 2 Hashim Amla, 3 Faf du Plessis (capt), 4 Rassie van der Dussen, 5 Aiden Markram, 6 David Miller, 7 Chris Morris, 8 Andile Phehlukwayo, 9 Kagiso Rabada, 10 Imran Tahir, 11 Lungi Ngidi</p>
<p>After scores of 8, 0 and 0, Shoaib Malik might have played his last game in a Pakistan shirt. Haris Sohail should take his place. Hasan Ali's lacklustre performances might push him to the bench, with Mohammad Hasnain poised to slot in.</p>
<p>Pakistan (possible): 1 Imam-ul-Haq, 2 Fakhar Zaman, 3 Babar Azam, 4 Mohammad Hafeez, 5 Sarfaraz Ahmed (capt &amp; wk), 6 Haris Sohail, 7 Shadab Khan, 8 Imad Wasim, 9 Mohammad Amir, 10 Wahab Riaz, 11 Shaheen Afridi</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Pitch and conditions</strong></p>
<p>The pitch the game will be played on has lost much of its green in the past 24 hours, and is likely to shed more by match time on Sunday. It's expected to be a flat wicket, good for batting.</p>
<p>These days, that would mean bowl first, but given Pakistan's misadventure with the toss against India last Sunday, this may just be a better toss to lose for them.</p>
<p>The pitch should be one that favours the batsmen more and given both teams’ weaknesses in chasing big totals, it should be a win toss and bat first wicket.</p>
<p>The temperature should range between 15-25 degree Celsius with some decent sunshine and very little chance of showers.</p>
<p>However, given that it’s England, the rain can come and go at any time and that could come into the equation today. </p>

Afghans search for maiden win but face mighty England,"<div class=""body field row margin-bottom""><div class=""field-items columns large-12 medium-12 small-12 end""><p>If recent history is to go by, England have been the big team that up and coming teams or as some like to say ‘minnows’ have had success against in World Cups.</p>
<p>Bangladesh have beaten them on 2011 and in 2015 and Ireland have won against the creators of cricket in 2011, chasing a record target.</p>
<p>This time though, the hosts seem to be in a different mood, not willing to give an inch to their opposition.</p>
<p>That will certainly be put to the test when they face Afghanistan, who are at the bottom of the points table and are the only side to not win a single game this tournament.</p>
<p>The two teams will do battle at Manchester, Tuesday, on what seems to be an uneven contest on paper. </p>
<p>England are the only team that have scored at more than six runs per over each time they have batted since the 2015 World Cup. </p>
<p>And their bowling, with the X-factor and raw pace of Jofra Archer has been able to defend the runs.</p>
<p>One can argue that the English team have already had their World Cup blip in the game where they lost against Pakistan - a team who was coming on the bounce of losing eleven straight ODI’s.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the Afghans have not shown the free-spirited style of cricket that many neutrals have fallen in love with.</p>
<p>From the sacking of their former captain Asghar Afghan just before the tournament to sending opener Mohammad Shahzad back home for an injury he claims doesn’t exist to recently dropping Najibullah Zadran - one of their in-form batsmen.</p>
<p>It’s difficult to see how Afghanistan can win or even compete against an English team brimming with talent and depth in all three departments, especially on home soil.</p>
<p>England will look to get two more points to their tally and further strengthen their grip on the top four stance but if the Afghans can find their mojo, and if rain curtails the game, we could be in for the tournament’s biggest upset.</p>
<p> </p>
<h1><strong>Teams</strong></h1>
<p>After his unexpected absence against South Africa, Najibullah seems sure to slot back into Afghanistan's middle order though who knows what the management is thinking at present.</p>
<p>Asghar Afghan didn't exactly justify his recall with a five-ball duck against South Africa, and may be the man to make way once again.</p>
<p>The prospect of spin may bring Mujeeb Ur Rahman back into the reckoning.</p>
<p><strong>Afghanistan’s probable lineup: </strong>1 Hazratullah Zazai, 2 Noor Ali Zadran, 3 Rahmat Shah, 4 Hashmatullah Shahidi, 5 Gulbadin Naib (capt), 6 Najibullah Zadran, 7 Mohammad Nabi, 8 Ikram Alikhil (wk), 9 Rashid Khan, 10 Mujeeb Ur Rahman, 11 Hamid Hassan</p>
<p>Jason Roy's absence has been confirmed after his hamstring tear against West Indies - he will miss the Sri Lanka match as well, with James Vince set to slot straight in at the top of the order. Morgan's fitness was also under a cloud after he suffered a back spasm, but he was moving freely in the nets on the eve of the game and may yet feature.</p>
<p>Liam Plunkett missed training with a stomach complaint but is not thought to be a serious concern.</p>
<p><strong>England’s probable lineup: </strong>1 Jonny Bairstow, 2 James Vince, 3 Joe Root, 4 Eoin Morgan (capt), 5 Ben Stokes, 6 Jos Buttler (wk), 7 Chris Woakes, 8 Adil Rashid, 9 Liam Plunkett, 10 Jofra Archer, 11 Mark Wood.</p>
<h1> </h1>
<h1><strong>Pitch and weather</strong></h1>
<p>The weather promises an overcast start and the potential for showers in the afternoon, and the eve of the game featured steady rain as well.</p>
<p>Captains winning the toss would be inclined to bowl first.</p>
<p>The pitch is expected to be very good for batting but it should offer spin and good carry for the pacers, as was the case in the last game here between India and Pakistan.</p>

Shakib believes batting at no.3 best for him,"<div class=""body field row margin-bottom""><div class=""field-items columns large-12 medium-12 small-12 end""><p>Bangladesh’s ace all-rounder Shakib al Hasan believes that because he is batting higher up the order at no.3, he is getting a better opportunity of scoring big and credits that to one of the reasons he’s been batting so well in the World Cup.</p>
<p>The left-handed batsman scored a brilliant 124-run innings off just 99 deliveries and helped Bangladesh chase down a challenging 322 target with ease against the Windies at Taunton on Monday.</p>
<p>“I know if I bat at 3 I'll get more opportunities, more time to bat. What happens is that sometimes if I bat at 5, I come in at the 30th over or 40th over, which I felt is not ideal for me,” Shakib said during the post-match presentation, where he was adjudged man-of-the-match.</p>
<p>The 32-year-old admitted that he has been putting an extra effort and working on his batting from his time in the Indian Premier League (IPL) with his batting coach Mohammad Salahuddin for the past month-and-a-half and that has reaped him rich rewards.</p>
<p>He also was very satisfied that he could see the big chase through and stay on till the end of the innings.  </p>
<p>“To stay at the wicket till the end was the most satisfying thing for me. I have been working on my batting for last month and a half and it’s paying off,” Shakib explained.</p>
<p>Shakib became the top run-scorer in the World Cup after his century with 384 runs while he was also effective with the ball, taking two wickets.</p>
<p>But he believes that it was a team effort and others also contributed to help achieve the win. Liton Das was not out on 94 and there in a mammoth 189-run partnership with him.</p>
<p><a href=""http://tbsnews.net/sports/shakib-century-seals-record-chase-tigers-0"">ALSO READ: Shakib century seals record chase for Tigers</a></p>
<p>Tamim Iqbal scored 48, his highest score this World Cup.</p>
<p>Mustafizur Rahman chipped in with three wickets including that of the dangerous Shimron Hetmyer and Andre Russell in the same over.</p>
<p>And Mohammad Saifuddin also took three wickets and one of them was of big-hitting Chris Gayle, who was dismissed for a 13-ball duck.</p>
<p>“I think it was a team effort. We restricted the West Indies to a reasonable total and at the end of the innings we had the belief that if we bat well then we can chase that run,” Shakib added.</p>
<p>Shakib has been a star with the bat and although he’s been among the wickets with the ball, he has been expensive. The left-armer admitted that he could still get better with his bowling.</p>
<p>“I'm working on my bowling too. At this moment I'm doing okay but I can certainly get better.” concluded an ambitious and optimistic Shakib.</p>

Ruman becomes first Bangladeshi Archer to win World Cup medal,"<div class=""body field row margin-bottom""><div class=""field-items columns large-12 medium-12 small-12 end""><p>Bangladesh’s top archer Md Ruman Shana made history as he became the first Bangladeshi to win a medal in World Archery Championship on Sunday.</p>
<p>Ruman ended his campaign on a high when he outplayed Mauro Nespoli of Italy by 7-1 set points in the bronze medal deciding match of men’s recurve event in the Netherlands.</p>
<p>The 24-year-old, who qualified for the Tokyo 2020 Olympics earlier for being among the top four, cruised to win the first set with 28-27 points and clinched the second set with 29-28.</p>
<p>Nepsoli, the world’s no. 6 ranked archer tried to stage a comeback as he tied the third set by 29-29 points.</p>
<p>With Ruman needing only one set point in remaining two sets, the lad from Khulna once again scored 29 against Mauro’s 27 to win the match by 7-1 set points.</p>
<p>Ruman had previously grabbed two gold medals on foreign soil in the First Asian Archery Grand Prix in 2014 and International Archery tournament in Kyrgyzstan in 2017.</p>
<p>But this eclipsed those performances as he won a bronze medal and had to compete against 200 archers from 92 nations including top archery nations like South Korea, Netherlands, USA, China, Chinese Taipei and India.</p>
<p>This year, Ruman played two finals in the ISSF Islamic Solidarity Archery Championships at Dhaka and the Asia Cup (Stage-1) but he had to be content with silver medals.</p>
<p>He had earlier won two more silver medals from the 2nd ISSF International Solidarity Archery Championships in 2018 and 3rd South Asian Archery Championship in 2018 held in Bangladesh.</p>

Sarfaraz blames another batting collapse for loss,"<div class=""body field row margin-bottom""><div class=""field-items columns large-12 medium-12 small-12 end""><p>Pakistan lost by 89-runs against India at Old Trafford in the ICC World Cup 2019 on Sunday, Sarfaraz Ahmed believes his side gave up all hopes of a win when they lost four wickets in three overs.</p>
<p>Pakistan, who at one point were in the chase at 117/1, lost Babar Azam, Fakhar Zaman, Mohammad Hafeez and Shoaib Malik for 12 runs within three overs as Kuldeep Yadav and Hardik Pandya caused havoc.</p>
<p>“The credit goes to India’s batsmen and also their bowlers for performing so well. We also lost the match in those three overs where we lost four wickets. Fakhar and Imam were going really well, but we collapsed after that,” Sarfaraz said in the post-match presentation ceremony.</p>
<p>Pakistan, like against Australia, were bowling first in conditions that promised help for the bowlers but no one other than Mohammad Amir really troubled the batsmen early on.</p>
<p>Even Pakistan’s Prime Minister and World Cup winning Captain in 1992, Imran Khan tweeted about the necessity to bat first if they won the toss. But Sarfaraz explained that with the consistent rain on Saturday and overcast conditions on Sunday, the fast bowlers were “raring to go and bowl out there”.  </p>
<p>“We won a good toss but didn't bowl in the right areas and Rohit (Sharma) played very well. Our plan was to pitch the ball up to Rohit, but we didn't execute it well. It was a good toss to win but we didn't capitalise on it,” the wicket-keeper batsman added.</p>
<p>For Pakistan, the road to the semis of the 2019 ICC World Cup now gets tougher as they have slipped to ninth on the table with three defeats to their name. Their next game will be against another struggling side in South Africa and the loser of that match will be eliminated.</p>

<p>Pakistan, who at one point were in the chase at 117/1, lost Babar Azam, Fakhar Zaman, Mohammad Hafeez and Shoaib Malik for 12 runs within three overs as Kuldeep Yadav and Hardik Pandya caused havoc.</p>
<p>“The credit goes to India’s batsmen and also their bowlers for performing so well. We also lost the match in those three overs where we lost four wickets. Fakhar and Imam were going really well, but we collapsed after that,” Sarfaraz said in the post-match presentation ceremony.</p>
<p>Pakistan, like against Australia, were bowling first in conditions that promised help for the bowlers but no one other than Mohammad Amir really troubled the batsmen early on.</p>
<p>Even Pakistan’s Prime Minister and World Cup winning Captain in 1992, Imran Khan tweeted about the necessity to bat first if they won the toss. But Sarfaraz explained that with the consistent rain on Saturday and overcast conditions on Sunday, the fast bowlers were “raring to go and bowl out there”.  </p>
<p>“We won a good toss but didn't bowl in the right areas and Rohit (Sharma) played very well. Our plan was to pitch the ball up to Rohit, but we didn't execute it well. It was a good toss to win but we didn't capitalise on it,” the wicket-keeper batsman added.</p>
<p>For Pakistan, the road to the semis of the 2019 ICC World Cup now gets tougher as they have slipped to ninth on the table with three defeats to their name. Their next game will be against another struggling side in South Africa and the loser of that match will be eliminated.</p>

Rohit ton guides India to seventh straight WC win over Pakistan,"<div class=""body field row margin-bottom""><div class=""field-items columns large-12 medium-12 small-12 end""><p>Rohit Sharma scored another silky century to lead India to an easy 89-run win over arch-rivals Pakistan during their ICC World Cup group stage match in Manchester on Sunday. It was always going to tough for Pakistan given their World Cup record against India which read six losses and zero wins and this loss further added to their woes.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>1st Innings</strong></p>
<p>After losing the toss and being put on to bat by Pakistan, India once again got off to a very solid start. KL Rahul was promoted up the order with Shikhar Dhawan out injured and he formed a solid 136-run partnership.</p>
<p>Wahab Riaz finally got the wicket of Rahul who scored a steady 57 off 78 but his departure only brought the best batsman in world cricket - Virat Kohli - to the middle. Kohli and Sharma then put up a 98-run stand as Sharma scored a majestic 140 off just 113 deliveries.</p>
<p>The right-handed opener looked dead set on scoring a big innings but he tried to scoop a slower ball from Hasan Ali and the lack of pace had him caught at short fine leg by Riaz. The 32-year-old’s 24th ODI century included 14 boundaries and three six and was a pure batting masterclass and it earned him the man-of-the-match award.</p>
<p>Kohli kept his innings going on the other end, becoming the fastest to reach 11 thousand ODI runs off just 222 innings as wickets fell at the other end. The Indian captain scored 77 off 65 balls but he ensured India had scored in excess of 300.</p>
<p>The Pakistani bowlers, especially Mohammad Amir - with figures of 3/47 off ten overs - tried his best to tame the flow of runs as what looked to be a 350-plus total eventually ended on 336/5, a formidable total nonetheless.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>2nd Innings</strong></p>
<p>Pakistan lost Imam-ul-Haq early to the bowling of Vijay Shankar, who came in place of the injured Dhawan but then Fakhar Zaman and Babar Azam counter-attacked. They looked well set to challenge and keep the chase on track.</p>
<p>But as has been the case in recent times, they lost a wicket - that of Babar Azam for 48 - and then they lost four more wickets to completely lose their way.</p>
<p>Fakhar Zaman tried to sweep Kuldeep Yadav but top-edged to Yuzvendra for 62. Mohammad Hafeez then flicked a Hardik Pandya delivery straight to deep-square leg Shakar for nine and in the very next delivery, Shoaib Malik was bowled by Pandya for a golden duck.</p>
<p>Captain Sarfaraz Ahmed was the last to be dismissed, played-on by an innocuous Shankar delivery and Pakistan had collapsed from 117/1 to 165/6 before rain arrived.</p>
<p>The match then started to lose overs and was reduced to 40 overs with Duckworth-Lewis-Stern (D/L/S) method giving Pakistan a target of 302. That meant they had to score 136 off 30 balls and that had pretty much sealed the result for Pakistan as they scored 212/6 in 40 overs.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Points Table</strong></p>
<p>The win takes India to seven points from four games and keeps them unbeaten as they climb to third spot, just behind Australia and New Zealand who are on eight and seven points respectively.</p>
<p>The loss keeps Pakistan stuck at ninth spot with just three points from five games and they will have to win all of their remaining games to stand a chance of qualifying in the semis.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Key Stats</strong></p>
<p>Rohit Sharma climbs up to second spot with 319 runs, just behind Aaron Finch in the list of top run-scorers this World Cup. Finch though has played one more match than Sharma with 343 runs.</p>
<p>Pakistan’s one positive of the day may be the bowling of Mohammad Amir who is joint-top in the wicket-takers list with 13 wickets, level with Australia’s Mitchell Starc. They are followed by Pat Cummins who has 11 wickets.</p>

Proteas thrash Afghans to grab first win,"<div class=""body field row margin-bottom""><div class=""field-items columns large-12 medium-12 small-12 end""><p>South Africa finally registered their first win in the ICC Cricket World Cup 2019 by defeating Afghanistan by nine wickets in Cardiff on Saturday.<br />
It was not the most convincing display from the Proteas but in the end a good bowling performance led by Imran Tahir meant that victory was a forgone conclusion. The leg-spinner was man-of-the-match for his 4/29 off seven overs. </p>
<p>1st Innings<br />
After winning the toss the Proteas decided to field first but the Afghans came out all guns blazing as they negotiated the fast bowling of Kagiso Rabada and Beuron Hendricks as Hazratullah Zazai and Noor Ali Zadran putting on 39 for the first wicket.<br />
Rain then came but after it went and play resuemed, Rabada dismissed Zazai. But then Zadran and Rahmat Shah kept things steady as rain came on for a longer time during their partnership to curtail the match to 48 over-a-side. After the rain break, Chris Morris took the wicket of Rahmat Shah and that sparked a big collapse.<br />
Captain Faf du Plessis rung in the changes to bring in Andile Phehlukwayo and he then took the wicket of Hashmatullah Shahidi who scored eight. Enter Imran Tahir in the 21st over and he immediately took the wicket for Zadran, who was cleaned up by a picture-perfect googly after scoring 32.<br />
There was some late fireworks from Rashid Khan, who top-scored with 35 and helped the Afghans cross the 100-run barrier, but after taking the attack to Tahir, he was caught at deep-midwicket by Rassie van der Dussen. Their innings ended at 125 all-out in just 34.1 overs.</p>
<p>2nd Innings<br />
In reply, openers Hashim Amla and Quinton de Kock started circumspect and scored just 35 runs in the first 10 overs. De Kock started to up the ante as South Africa reached the team 50 after 13 overs.<br />
The left-handed opener reached his half century a while later, off 58 balls. Amla was still plodding along, and visibly struggling to find his timing. South Africa were 91 for no loss after the first 20 overs, going slower than expected whereas one would have thought they’d want to bat faster and improve their net run rate.<br />
De Kock and Amla eventually brought up their 100-run opening partnership in 22.3 overs with Amla scoring just 34 and de Kock scoring almost his double at 64. The wicketkeeper-batsman was eventually dismissed for 68 as he was trying to up the ante and became Afghan captain Gulbadin Naib’s first and only wicket.<br />
Phehlukwayo was promoted up the order to finish things quickly and he did so by hitting the winning runs as he smashed a six in the fourth ball of the 29th over off the bowling of Mohammad Nabi.<br />
He scored 17 off as many balls while Amla, who still looked to be struggling for form remained not out on 41 from 83 balls.</p>
<p>Points Table<br />
The win will come as a big relief for South Africa, even though they could have won with a better net run rate by batting faster. But their World Cup campaign remains alive by the thinnest of threads as they climb up to 7th place with three points from five games.<br />
They have to win all of their remaining games against New Zealand, Sri Lanka, Pakistan and Australia and have a good net run rate to make the semis.<br />
Unfortunately for the Afghans, this defeats ends any chance they would have had of making the semis and they are the first team eliminated with no points from four games. </p>

It was not the most convincing display from the Proteas but in the end a good bowling performance led by Imran Tahir meant that victory was a forgone conclusion. The leg-spinner was man-of-the-match for his 4/29 off seven overs. </p>
<p>1st Innings<br />
After winning the toss the Proteas decided to field first but the Afghans came out all guns blazing as they negotiated the fast bowling of Kagiso Rabada and Beuron Hendricks as Hazratullah Zazai and Noor Ali Zadran putting on 39 for the first wicket.<br />
Rain then came but after it went and play resuemed, Rabada dismissed Zazai. But then Zadran and Rahmat Shah kept things steady as rain came on for a longer time during their partnership to curtail the match to 48 over-a-side. After the rain break, Chris Morris took the wicket of Rahmat Shah and that sparked a big collapse.<br />
Captain Faf du Plessis rung in the changes to bring in Andile Phehlukwayo and he then took the wicket of Hashmatullah Shahidi who scored eight. Enter Imran Tahir in the 21st over and he immediately took the wicket for Zadran, who was cleaned up by a picture-perfect googly after scoring 32.<br />
There was some late fireworks from Rashid Khan, who top-scored with 35 and helped the Afghans cross the 100-run barrier, but after taking the attack to Tahir, he was caught at deep-midwicket by Rassie van der Dussen. Their innings ended at 125 all-out in just 34.1 overs.</p>
<p>2nd Innings<br />
In reply, openers Hashim Amla and Quinton de Kock started circumspect and scored just 35 runs in the first 10 overs. De Kock started to up the ante as South Africa reached the team 50 after 13 overs.<br />
The left-handed opener reached his half century a while later, off 58 balls. Amla was still plodding along, and visibly struggling to find his timing. South Africa were 91 for no loss after the first 20 overs, going slower than expected whereas one would have thought they’d want to bat faster and improve their net run rate.<br />
De Kock and Amla eventually brought up their 100-run opening partnership in 22.3 overs with Amla scoring just 34 and de Kock scoring almost his double at 64. The wicketkeeper-batsman was eventually dismissed for 68 as he was trying to up the ante and became Afghan captain Gulbadin Naib’s first and only wicket.<br />
Phehlukwayo was promoted up the order to finish things quickly and he did so by hitting the winning runs as he smashed a six in the fourth ball of the 29th over off the bowling of Mohammad Nabi.<br />
He scored 17 off as many balls while Amla, who still looked to be struggling for form remained not out on 41 from 83 balls.</p>
<p>Points Table<br />
The win will come as a big relief for South Africa, even though they could have won with a better net run rate by batting faster. But their World Cup campaign remains alive by the thinnest of threads as they climb up to 7th place with three points from five games.<br />
They have to win all of their remaining games against New Zealand, Sri Lanka, Pakistan and Australia and have a good net run rate to make the semis.<br />
Unfortunately for the Afghans, this defeats ends any chance they would have had of making the semis and they are the first team eliminated with no points from four games. </p>

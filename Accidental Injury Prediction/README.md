ðŸš— Accidental Injury Prediction Using Machine Learning

ðŸ“˜ Project Description:

This project uses machine learning to predict the severity of road accidents (Minor, Medium, Major) by analyzing real-world accident data. It aims to assist traffic authorities and drivers in understanding risk levels and promoting safer roads through data-driven insights.

ðŸ”‘ Key Features:

Predicts accident severity based on various factors (driver, vehicle, road, weather).

Collects form-based input and returns real-time severity predictions.

Provides safety alerts to encourage better driving behavior.

Compares multiple machine learning models to ensure optimal accuracy.
